# Balancer V3 ERC4626 Fork Tests

This repository contains tests to ensure that an ERC4626 token is compatible with Balancer V3 buffers. For 
compatibility, an ERC4626 token must meet the following requirements:

### Full ERC4626 Compliance  

The token must implement all functions defined by the 
[ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard. The tests validate the correct 
implementation of the following functions:

- `asset`
- `convertToAssets`
- `convertToShares`
- `previewDeposit`
- `previewMint`
- `previewWithdraw`
- `previewRedeem`
- `deposit`
- `mint`
- `withdraw`
- `redeem`

### No Deposit or Withdraw Fees

The ERC4626 wrapper should not impose deposit or withdrawal fees. For example, a deposit of `amount` tokens should 
allow the user to withdraw at least `amount - 1` tokens.

### Accurate Conversions

The `convert` and `preview` functions must produce results that are close, with a maximum allowable difference of 1 wei.

### Preview and Operation Consistency 

The results of `preview` functions must match the outcomes of their corresponding operations precisely.

### Exact-Input for Deposit and Redeem

The `deposit` and `redeem` functions must behave as **EXACT_IN** functions, consuming the exact amount of tokens specified in their input arguments.

### Exact-Output for Mint and Withdraw

The `mint` and `withdraw` functions must behave as **EXACT_OUT** functions, returning the exact number of tokens specified in their output values.

### Flashloan Incompatibility

In terms of all ERC4626 vaults, there is an [inherent incompatibility](https://docs.morpho.org/morpho-vaults/tutorials/vault-token-asset/) related to flash loans. When an ERC4626 is deposited into a contract that can be flashloaned, an issue arises where a user can frontrun bad debt socialization by flashloaning the shares and then withdrawing them, which amplifies the bad debt. This is limited by the amount available to flashloan AND withdrawable liquidity in the pool.
